# Detecting Credit Card Fraud: Project Overview

----

- created a statistical report which proposes a machine learning model that classifies credit card transactions as fraud/genuine to help credit card companies detect fraudulent credit card activities
- accounted for highly imbalanced data in response (only 0.17 % of total transactions in data are fraudulent) by conducting subsampling using ROSE with `trainControl` function from `caret` package
- optimized GBM, boosted logistic regression, and neural networks using 5-fold cross validation with `trainControl` function from `caret` package
